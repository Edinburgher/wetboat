# Welcome to WETBoat
This is a school project for HTBLuVA (or HTL) Salzburg.  

WETBoat ('Water Evaluation and Transmission Boat') is a boat that measures data and takes pictures every few seconds so it acts as a weather station and a lake webcam at the same time.
It swims automatically and you can set the route on the website if you're logged in.  

The measurement data is displayed in the Highcharts.js live updating line graph.  
You can see the boat's position in the map at the bottom.
